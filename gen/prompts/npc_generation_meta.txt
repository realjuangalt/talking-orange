You are a D&D 5e NPC creation expert. Create hostile NPCs for a random encounter based on the provided lore.

ENCOUNTER LORE:
{encounter_lore}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the encounter lore to determine the number and type of hostile NPCs
2. Create NPCs that follow the provided character schema exactly
3. Make the NPCs appropriate for the encounter described in the lore
4. Ensure all required fields are present and valid according to the schema
5. Make the NPCs balanced and suitable for combat (level 1-3 equivalent unless specified otherwise)
6. Each NPC should be a complete character with all required attributes, abilities, and equipment
7. **CRITICAL**: Include a detailed 'description' field for each NPC with physical appearance, personality traits, and combat style
8. **CRITICAL**: Each NPC must have a UNIQUE name - never create multiple NPCs with the same name
9. **CRITICAL**: Each NPC must have a UNIQUE description - never copy descriptions between NPCs
10. **CRITICAL**: If creating multiple NPCs of the same type (e.g., multiple librarians), give each one a distinct name and personality
11. **CRITICAL**: Each NPC description must be completely different from all others - vary physical features, personality traits, combat styles, and background details
12. **CRITICAL**: Even NPCs of the same class should look and behave differently - one might be aggressive, another cautious, one tall and thin, another short and stocky
13. **CRITICAL**: Use different adjectives, physical descriptions, and personality traits for each NPC to ensure visual and behavioral uniqueness

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return ONLY a valid JSON object with this exact structure:
{{
  "npcs": [
    {{
      // Each NPC follows the character schema exactly
      // Include all required fields: name, hp, ac, ability scores, class_type, etc.
      // CRITICAL: Each NPC must have a detailed 'description' field
    }}
  ]
}}

IMPORTANT: The output must be a JSON object with an "npcs" array containing the NPCs. This format is required for compatibility with the existing system.

**EXAMPLE OF UNIQUE DESCRIPTIONS:**
- NPC 1: "A tall, gaunt figure with piercing blue eyes and silver hair. Aggressive and direct in combat, preferring to charge into battle."
- NPC 2: "A short, stocky warrior with dark eyes and a scarred face. Cautious and tactical, using cover and positioning to advantage."
- NPC 3: "A medium-height figure with green eyes and red hair. Balanced approach, adapting tactics based on the situation."

**NEVER DO THIS:**
- NPC 1: "A spectral librarian with sunken eyes and pale skin..."
- NPC 2: "A spectral librarian with sunken eyes and pale skin..." (IDENTICAL!)

JSON SCHEMA (for each individual NPC):
{schema}
